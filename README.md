## Architecture Overview  

```bash

+-------------------+        +-------------------+        +-------------------+
|   User Browser    | <----> |   Frontend (React) | <----> | Netlify Functions |
| (HTML/CSS/JS)     |        |  - UI Components   |        |  - OpenAI Proxy   |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+        +-------------------+
                                 |   ^
                                 |   |
                                 v   |
                      +---------------------------+
                      |      OpenAI API (GPT)      |
                      +---------------------------+
```



- User Interaction ‚Äì The React app captures user input via a chat interface.  
- API Gateway ‚Äì Netlify Functions act as a thin proxy that injects the API key securely and forwards the prompt to OpenAI.  
- Response Handling ‚Äì The AI‚Äôs answer is streamed back, parsed, and displayed as chat bubbles.  
- Stateless Session ‚Äì Conversation context is held in the browser memory; no server‚Äëside persistence.
